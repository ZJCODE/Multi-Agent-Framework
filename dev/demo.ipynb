Instrumental music often works best, as it allows you to focus on the text without the interference of lyrics. Here are a few genres and specific recommendations:\\n\\n1. **Classical Music**: Composers like Johann Sebastian Bach and Claude Debussy have created beautiful pieces that can enhance your reading experience. For example, Bach\\'s \"Goldberg Variations\" is calming and uplifting, while Debussy\\'s \"Clair de Lune\" offers a dreamy atmosphere.\\n\\n2. **Ambient Music**: Artists like Brian Eno specialize in ambient music that is designed to create a tranquil environment. His album \"Music for Airports\" is an excellent choice for a peaceful backdrop.\\n\\n3. **Jazz**: Soft jazz can also be a great option. Look for smooth jazz playlists that feature artists like Miles Davis or Bill Evans, whose gentle melodies can create a relaxing vibe.\\n\\n4. **Lo-fi Hip Hop**: This genre has gained popularity for studying and reading. You can find countless \"lo-fi hip hop\" playlists on streaming platforms that offer a blend of mellow beats ideal for concentration.\\n\\n5. **Nature Sounds**: If you prefer something even more minimal, consider listening to nature sounds or soundscapes. These can range from gentle rain to ocean waves, providing a serene backdrop without any musical distraction.\\n\\nFeel free to explore these suggestions and find what resonates best with your reading style!')"
