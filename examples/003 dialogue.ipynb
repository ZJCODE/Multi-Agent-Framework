I told him I was making pancakes and asked what he wanted to drink. Tom said he would love orange juice. I then asked Jerry if he wanted pancakes, and he excitedly requested them with syrup, strawberries, and whipped cream. Tom chimed in, saying that it all sounded delicious and suggested we sit together for breakfast. I agreed and assured Jerry I'd add the whipped cream. Spike started barking with excitement about breakfast, and Tom told him to calm down. I informed Tom that I was making pancakes and scrambled eggs. He expressed his excitement for the meal, and I reassured him that breakfast would be ready soon. \n",
